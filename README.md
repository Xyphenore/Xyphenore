## Welcome on my profile !

I'm passionate about developing C++ software and libraries in my free time. I love exploring strong typing techniques like those discussed in Fluent C++'s [Strong Types](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2016/12/05/named-constructors/). I'm a fan of clean code, expressive code and the effective use of design patterns (when it's useful).

When I not doing code, I'm playing video games, listening music or watching anime like [SNK - Attack on Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan), [Evangelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion), [Initial D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_D) or [Psycho-Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho-Pass).

### Current projects:

I'm currently working on rebuilding [shape-editor](https://github.com/Xyphenore/shape-editor_OLD) from C++11 to C++20. For this goal, I've developed several libraries like [integers](https://github.com/Xyphenore/integers) and [common-concepts](https://github.com/Xyphenore/common_concepts). I'm also focused on improving [ez-draw++](http://eric.remy3.free.fr/EZ-Draw++/EZ-Draw++-1.2-6/html/index.html) by using RAII, smart pointers, the STL library and new C++20 features. It's a long-term project as [ez-draw++](http://eric.remy3.free.fr/EZ-Draw++/EZ-Draw++-1.2-6/html/index.html) is a header-only library initially coded in C++11. It takes significant effort to convert the library while maintaining the same logic without testss. Therefore, I'm searching for solutions to test the current version of [ez-draw++](http://eric.remy3.free.fr/EZ-Draw++/EZ-Draw++-1.2-6/html/index.html) accross different OS (Linux/Windows).

- [ez-draw-pp](https://github.com/Xyphenore/ez-draw-pp): A improved version of [ez-draw++](http://eric.remy3.free.fr/EZ-Draw++/EZ-Draw++-1.2-6/html/index.html) using C++20, RAII, design patterns, STL and smart pointers to enhance memory security.
- [common_concepts](https://github.com/Xyphenore/common_concepts): Common concepts used in various projects.
- [integers](https://github.com/Xyphenore/integers): Strong types for negative, positive and not null integers.
- [shape_editor (new version)](https://github.com/Xyphenore/shapes_editor): An improved version of [shape-editor](https://github.com/Xyphenore/shape-editor_OLD) using C++20 for enhanced memory security.
- stringify (currently private): A common concept to stringify any object using 'std::to_string'.
